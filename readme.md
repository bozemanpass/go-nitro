<p align="center">Implementation of the <a href="https://docs.statechannels.org">Nitro State Channels Framework</a> in Golang and Solidity.</p>

## Usage

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Go-nitro is pre-production software ‚ö†Ô∏è

### As a Service

Go-nitro can be run as a system service with an RPC api. Go-nitro's default configuration is to connect with a local hardhat blockchain on port `8548` with chainid `1337`.

A suitably configured node as a docker container is maintained here: https://github.com/statechannels/hardhat-docker, but default hardhat nodes work as well.

After a hardhat node is running, go-nitro can be started from the root directory with

```
go run .
```

Or, built to an executable binary with

```
go build -o gonitro
```
```

### As a Library

Go-nitro is also work-in-progress library code with an evolving API.

Our [integration tests](./client_test/readme.md) give the best idea of how to use the API. Another useful resource is [the godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/statechannels/go-nitro@v0.0.0-20221013015616-00c5614be2d2/client#Client) description of the `go-nitro.Client` API (please check for the latest version).

Broadly, consumers will construct a go-nitro `Client`, possibly using injected dependencies. Then, they can create channels and send payments:

```Go
 import nc "github.com/statechannels/go-nitro/client"

 nitroClient := nc.New(
                    messageservice,
                    chain,
                    storeA,
                    logDestination,
                    nil,
                    nil
                )
response := nitroClient.CreateLedgerChannel(hub.Address, 0, someOutcome)
nitroClient.WaitForCompletedObjective(response.objectiveId)

response = nitroClient.CreateVirtualPaymentChannel([hub.Address],bob.Address, defaultChallengeDuration, someOtherOutcome)
nitroClient.WaitForCompletedObjective(response.objectiveId)

for i := 0; i < len(10); i++ {
    clientA.Pay(response.ChannelId, big.NewInt(int64(5)))
}

response = nitroClient.CloseVirtualChannel(response.ChannelId)
nitroClient.WaitForCompletedObjective(response.objectiveId)
```

## Roadmap

The following roadmap gives an idea of the various packages that compose the `go-nitro` module, and their implementation status:

```bash
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ abi ‚úÖ                     # types for abi encoding and decoding.

‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ state ‚úÖ               # generate and recover signatures on state updates
‚îÇ¬†¬†     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outcome ‚úÖ         # define how funds are dispersed when a channel closes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client üöß                  # exposes an API to the consuming application
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ engine ‚úÖ              # coordinate the client components, runs the protocols

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types ‚úÖ                   # basic types and utility methods
```

## On-chain code

The on-chain component of Nitro (i.e. the solidity contracts) are housed in the [`nitro-protocol`](./nitro-protocol/readme.md) directory. This directory contains an npm package with a hardhat / typechain / jest toolchain.
